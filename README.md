# Loan Repayment Prediction System

## 📌 Project Description
The Loan Repayment Prediction System is a machine learning–based application that predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for loan approval based on financial and demographic data. The system analyzes factors such as income, credit history, loan amount, and loan term to support data-driven decision making.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and backend deployment using Flask, along with a simple frontend for user interaction.
